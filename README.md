### Nicolas Dumazet

I publicly version here my personal configuration files, and sources for my personal website.

I work for Google, in the Security field. There I'm `ndumazet@`.  

I used to contribute a lot to public projects as a student and during my earlier career (Mercurial, Mediawiki), but this isn't part of my core job anymore. You may find me contributing back small fixes for bugs/things I find in the course of my job or during my freetime.
