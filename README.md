### Nicolas Dumazet

I publicly version here my personal configuration files, and sources for my personal website.

I used to contribute a lot to public projects (Mercurial, Mediawiki) but I'm not spending time on this anymore. You may find me contributing back small fixes for bugs/things I find in the course of my job.

I work for Google, where I'm `ndumazet@`.
